<h1 align="center">Hey!! 👋, I'm Pratyush Prateek</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a DevOps Engineer with 1.5 years of experience specializing in Kubernetes (AKS), CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, automation, and observability. I enjoy solving reliability challenges, improving deployment workflows, and building efficient systems that scale.

My experience includes managing Kubernetes environments, troubleshooting pod-level issues, monitoring services using Prometheus & Grafana, and automating operations with Python and Bash. I have worked extensively with Azure (AKS, Azure DevOps, Key Vault, Azure Monitor) and built pipelines that support fast, reliable, and secure delivery of applications.

I also focus on service reliability—reducing MTTD/MTTR, improving alerting, and supporting incident response. I’m passionate about infrastructure-as-code and have hands-on experience creating Terraform modules and deploying cloud resources with best practices.

I’m continuously building personal projects to sharpen my DevOps and SRE skills, including Kubernetes-based deployments, CI/CD pipelines, observability stacks, and automation tools. I believe in clean automation, strong debugging skills, and end-to-end visibility as core principles of DevOps.

I am now looking for opportunities in DevOps or SRE roles, especially in product-based companies, where I can contribute to scalable systems, enhance reliability, and grow as an engineer.</h3>
